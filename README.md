## Game Data

Data is loaded in from one of three locations, relative to the executable, including:

- `/share/cs327/pokedex/pokedex/data/csv/`
- `~/.cs327/`
- `../data/`

Important: the various .csv files MUST be directly within these directories. If they aren't found, the program will panic and throw an error.

To continue, we load the following data types:

- Experience (experience.csv)
- Moves (moves.csv)
- Pokemon (pokemon.csv)
- Pokemon Moves (pokemon_moves.csv)
- Pokemon Species (pokemon_species.csv)
- Pokemon Stats (pokemon_stats.csv)
- Pokemon Types (pokemon_types.csv)
- Stats (stats.csv)
- Type Names (type_names.csv)

## Trainers

In order to pick the number of trainers that spawn on the map, you can run the binary with the `--numtrainers` flag. Here's a sample of choosing 7 trainers:

`./main --numtrainers 7`

### Trainer Interface

In order to open the trainer interface, you can hit `t`. To close this interface, you can hit `escape`. The trainer interface will report the nearby Pokemon along with their locations relative to the player. In order to scroll through the Pokemon list, you can use `up arrow` and `down arrow`. Please note, opening the trainer interface uses a turn!

### Trainer Battles

All trainers are undefeated when they initially spawn. When you move into a trainer's tile or a trainer moves in your tile, a battle is initiated. At this time, the game simply display's the trainer's pokemon. A trainer has a 60% chance of receiving an n+1 pokemon, however all trainers have at least 1 pokemon. You can simply hit `escape` to exit. After doing so, the respective trainer becomes defeated.

### Hikers and Rivals

Hikers and Rivals follow an efficient path to the player based on their respective cost maps. Note that if there is no valid path to the player as that player is blocked by other trainers or immovable terrain, then hikers and rivals will not move. Moreover, if a Hiker or Rival is defeated, they will instead choose to move in a random direction, rather than pathing to the player.

### Pacers

Pacers choose a single direction and move in that direction until they hit an immovable object. Then, they turn around and repeat.

### Wanderers

Wanderers move in a random directon and continue that direction until they reach the end of their current terrain type. Then, they pick another direction to stay within the terrain limits.

### Explorers

Explorers move like wanderers, except they can leave the current terrain type.

### Sentries

Sentries don't move at all! Be wary!

## Building the Project

- To build the project, simply run `make`. This will generate a variety of output files, along with the executable `main`.
- To run the project, open a terminal and type `./main`.

## Controls

The game features a variety of controls. Building or interface specific controls can be found in their respective sections as well as in the following list.

- `Q` or `q` to quit.
- `7` or `y` to move to the north west.
- `8` or `k` to move north.
- `6` or `l` to move east.
- `3` or `n` to move south east.
- `2` or `j` to move south.
- `1` or `b` to move south west.
- `4` or `h` to move left.
- `>` to open a Pokemon Center or Pokemart interface (requires standing on the respective tile).
- `<` to close a Pokemon Center or Pokemart interface.
- `5` or `space` or `.` to rest for a turn.
- `t` to display a list of trainers.
- `escape` to exit any interface.
- `up arrow` to navigate in certain interfaces.
- `down arrow` to navigate in certain interfaces.
- `f` to fly between maps. After enabling fly, you'll be prompted to enter coordinates `x` and `y` like so: `<x> <y>`. When you hit enter, you will land in the desired map.
- `b` to open the inventory interface. From here, you can use potions and revives. Moreover, you can see how many potions, revives, and pokeballs you have left!

## Buildings

The game features two buildings, a Pokemon Center (C) and a Pokemart (M). Upon pathing to a respective building, you can open the building's interface with the `>` key. In order to close the interface, press the `<` key.

### Pokemon Center

Upon entering a Pokemon Center, all of your pokemon are healed to full health!

### Pokemart

Upon entering a Pokemart, all of your supplies are replenished. This includes potions, revives, and pokeballs.

## Battles

Battles are currently not implemented. At this time, should you enter a battle by doing one of the following:

1. Encountering a wild Pokemon in tall grass (10% chance)
2. Entering a trainer's tile

You will be presented with a screen that displays the Pokemon you're battling. If you're battling a trainer, new Pokemon will appear as they send them out.

### Battle Interface

The battle interface is fairly simple. You can do one of the following:

1. Fight
2. Bag
3. Run
4. Pokemon

#### Fight

When you select fight, you'll be presented with a list of moves. You can select a move by using number keys. Upon selecting a move, you will perform the move! Note, however, if your move's priority is less than that of the opponent and they also choose to fight, they will attack first.

#### Bag

When you select bag, you'll be presented with the ability to use a potion, revive, or, if you're in a wild battle, a pokeball. You can select an item by using number keys. Upon selecting an item, you will use the item!

#### Run

When you select run, you'll attempt to run from the battle. You can only run from a wild pokemon battle. You also have a 50% chance of failing to run. Note, this will use your turn!

#### Pokemon

When you select pokemon, you'll be presented with a list of your pokemon. You can select a pokemon by using number keys. Upon selecting a pokemon, you will switch to that pokemon! Note, however, switching pokemon uses a turn.

## Debugging

This iteration of the project contains a `--debug` flag. You can run the sudo debugger by using this flag. If the developers left any debugging comments in the code, they will be output to a `debug.txt` in the same direction as `./main` when the flag is enabled. Feel free to enable this feature for some easter eggs.
