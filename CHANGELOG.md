- 09/17/2023, 11:10 PM: Made `Makefile` dependent on intermediate object files
- 09/18/2023, 12:40 AM: Adapted fibbonacci heap structures and implementation
- 09/20/2023, 3:15 PM: Bailed on the fibbonacci heap due to various segfaults
- 09/20/2023, 4:24 PM: Used the existing queue to implement dijkstras, rather than a fibonacci heap.
- 09/20/2023, 6:53 PM: Finished implementing the cost matrix logic.
- 09/20/2023, 7:18 PM: Placed the Player on a random entrance to each room.
- 09/20/2023, 8:28 PM: Implemented the matrix output in the game loop when moving rooms.
- 09/21/2023, 11:33 AM: Finished reimplementing
- 09/21/2023, 11:46 AM: Per assignment guidelines, Player is now placed on a random path in each room
- 09/21/2023, 12:07 PM: Made entrances (gates) take on an infinite travel cost, per assignment guidelines
- 09/21/2023, 12:40 PM: Cost is considered when traveling to a tile, not from.
- 10/03/2023, 9:47 AM: Stripped out request for user input, display of hiker/rival cost maps, and other items not necessary for 1.04.

- 10/04/2023, 1:53 AM: Fixed a bug where sentries were causing the map not to display due to infinitely searching for a tile placement with a movement cost < INT_MAX.
- 10/04/2023, 4:52 PM: Implemented movement logic for Hiker, Rival
- 10/04/2023, 7:35 PM: Implemented movement logic for Pacer, Explorer, and Wanderer
- 10/04/2023, 7:41 PM: Fixed a bug where some trainers were entered the player character's tile.
